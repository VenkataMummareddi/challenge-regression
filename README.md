## The Mission
The real estate company "ImmoEliza"  needs  a machine learning model to predict prices on Belgium's sales.

#### Data Cleaning**  
we have collected your data, we have cleaned and analyze it a first time! 

we have to prepare the data for machine learning.

* No duplicates
* No NANs
* No text data
* No features that have too strong correlation between them

#### Data formatting**  
Now that the dataset is ready, you have to format it for machine learning:
* Divide you `X` and your `y`
* Divide your dataset for training and testion. (`X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test`)

#### Model selection**
The dataset is ready. Now let's select a model.

Look which model make the more sense according to your data.



#### Apply your model!**
We have selected XGBRegressor Sklearn model to train the data
Apply your model on your data.

#### Model evaluation**
Which accuracy did you reach?

We have reached accuracy of 0.7013740583877897

Try to answer those questions:
* How could you improve this result?
  We have to contrate more on preprocessing and caterozing columns nicely as well as finding
  more best algorithm from sk learn.
* Which part of the process it have the more impact on the results?
  preprocessing is having more impact on the results
* How should you divide your time working on this kind of project?
